# calaorie-calculator
This Python script uses the OpenAI API to generate nutrition information for a given food item. It constructs a prompt for the GPT-3.5 model, asking it to provide nutritional information in a specific format. The script then sends this prompt to the OpenAI API and extracts the generated nutrition information from the response.

To use the script, you need to replace `####` with your actual OpenAI API key. Then, you can run the script, enter a food item when prompted, and it will generate and display the nutrition information for that food item.
